# The 5 Metrics Every eCommerce CEO Must Track Weekly

As an eCommerce CEO, you're busy. But if you're not reviewing these five metrics every single week, you're running on hope — not strategy.

## 1. **LTV:CAC Ratio**
Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) divided by Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) tells you one thing: Are you scaling profitably?

- Aim for 3:1 or higher.
- If it's below 2:1, you're likely burning cash with each new order.

## 2. **Average Order Value (AOV) by Channel**
Not all traffic is equal. Email might bring $80 orders while Meta ads bring $45 orders.

- Segment AOV by acquisition channel.
- Optimize your spend where margins are stronger.

## 3. **Return Rate by SKU**
A SKU with a 40% return rate is a silent killer.

- Always review SKU-level return performance.
- Consider removing or improving low-performing products.

## 4. **Contribution Margin**
Forget gross margin. Contribution margin factors in ad spend, variable costs, and returns.

- It’s the clearest view of product-level profit.
- Run weekly snapshots to see how marketing impacts actual profit.

## 5. **60-Day Cohort Retention**
Cohort analysis reveals how often customers come back.

- Track % of new customers who repurchase within 60 days.
- A strong retention curve predicts stable revenue and LTV.

## Final Thought

If you're only tracking revenue and ROAS, you're flying blind.
