# How to Calculate True Product Profitability (It’s Not What You Think)

Let me ask you a question:

**Do you know which of your products is actually making you the most money?**

Most DTC founders *think* they do. They check their Shopify dashboard, sort by sales volume or gross margin, and assume those are their heroes.

But that data lies.

## Why Gross Margin Isn’t Enough

Gross margin is only the first layer of profit. It tells you:

- Revenue - COGS = gross margin

But it *doesn’t* account for:

- Paid ads to acquire that customer
- Return/refund rates per SKU
- Discounting patterns
- Packaging, shipping, or storage costs
- Customer support time per product

That’s why a high-margin SKU can still *lose money*.

## Introducing: Contribution Margin

**Contribution margin = [Product Revenue - Variable Costs] / Product Revenue**

It shows how much profit each product contributes to the business *after all associated variable costs*.

Let’s say:

- Product A sells for $80
- COGS = $30
- Ad cost per sale = $20
- Returns = 10% of orders = $8 cost avg
- Packaging & fulfillment = $5

**Gross Margin** = $80 - $30 = $50
**Contribution Margin** = $80 - ($30 + $20 + $8 + $5) = **$17**

Now imagine scaling Product A with paid ads, thinking it’s your hero. You could be bleeding cash.

## Where Profit Really Hides

When we audit DTC brands, we usually find that:

- 20% of SKUs drive 80% of actual profit
- Some bestsellers have negative contribution margin
- Bundles often outperform standalone products

Knowing this lets us:

- Kill unprofitable SKUs
- Reallocate ad spend
- Build bundles around top earners
- Adjust pricing based on real margins

## How to Start Tracking This

You don’t need a full data team. Start with:

1. Pull SKU-level sales, returns, and discounting
2. Map average CAC per product if possible
3. Include fulfillment, support, and packaging costs
4. Calculate per-unit profit across all channels

Even rough estimates are better than flying blind.

## The Real Power of Profit Mapping

With visibility, one of our clients removed 6 SKUs, redirected ad spend to 3 products, and grew monthly profit by 28% — without changing revenue.

## Final Thought

Gross margin is what looks good on a spreadsheet.

Contribution margin is what keeps you in business.
